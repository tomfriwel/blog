**A view angle can be used to create compelling composition to a photo. By choosing unusual angle of view, one can create a composition that is something out of the ordinary.**

**视角可用于为照片创建引人注目的构图。通过选择不寻常的视角，人们可以创造出与众不同的构图。**

You often see photos of famous sights that are photographed from the eye level and straight from in front of the sight. Many photos are taken from the most natural location and view angle which is of course logical. However, it means that many photos taken by different people from the same sight might look somewhat similar. That can be boring because the view in the photos is something that everybody sees while walking by the sight. The appeal of a photo can often be increased by choosing an unusual view angle instead of the natural one.

您经常会看到从视线水平拍摄并从视线前方直接拍摄的著名景点的照片。许多照片都是从最自然的位置和视角拍摄的，这当然是合乎逻辑的。然而，这意味着不同人从同一视线拍摄的许多照片可能看起来有些相似。这会变得很无聊，因为这些照片是每个人在走过这些景象时都会看到的。通常可以通过选择不寻常的视角而不是自然视角来增加照片的吸引力。

### 不同寻常

There are often many possibilities to choose a more compelling view angle than the usual one that everybody have already seen. The photo is usually more interesting when the chosen angle of view differs from the ordinary. Of course, the photographer needs go to a lot of trouble to achieve something different. If you take the photo from a lot lower or from a lot higher angle of view than the eye level, the chances are that the photo is something out of the ordinary. I tried this approach with picture 1. The building in the picture is Cathedral of Palma in Majorca in Spain. It's a famous sight. I wanted to capture something unusual and chose a very low angle of view. Here you can read more about the photo in question.

通常有许多可能性来选择比每个人都已经看到的通常更具吸引力的视角。 当所选择的视角与普通视角不同时，照片通常更有趣。 当然，摄影师需要为实现这样的拍摄而遇到很多麻烦。如果您从较低的视角拍摄照片或从较高的视角拍摄照片，那么照片可能会出现与众不同的情况。我用图片1尝试了这种方法。图中的建筑是西班牙马略卡岛的帕尔马大教堂。 这是一个著名的景点。 我想捕捉一些不寻常的东西，并选择了一个非常低的视角。 [在这里，您可以阅读有关相关照片的更多信息。](http://www.secondpicture.com/blog/cathedral_of_palma.html)

### Low View Angle Composition

Picture 2 is taken from the ground level. The subject is left in the distance on purpose. The desired story is to tell that people are alone in the middle of nowhere. The placement of the people where chosen by using the rule of thirds. Additionally, many lines of the photo lead the eye to the subject, which enhances the composition. The low view angle ensures that the photo is something different than many other snapshots of the same situation.

The example photos on this page are both taken from a low angle of view. That is only one way of creating unusual angle of view. It's worth it to also try high view angle or any other view angle that is something different than what everybody sees.
