[Things to Avoid in Composition](http://www.secondpicture.com/tutorials/photography/things_to_avoid_in_picture_composition.html)

翻译方式是通过谷歌翻译后做一些优化。

One usually tries to compose the elements of a photograph in a pleasing and interesting way. Often one tries to utilize certain rule or style that has been verified to work. Picture composition can be approached also from another perspective. When composing a photo one can think about things that should be avoided in the composition. In my opinion, once the good composition has been found, one should check certain things that can generally speaking be considered as mistakes in image composition.

人们通常喜欢使图片中的元素看上去更吸引人、更舒服。 通常人们会尝试使用那些已经被验证为有效的构图技巧或风格。 当然人们也可以通过另一个角度来进行构图。比如在构图的时候，可以考虑哪些东西是应该避免的。 在我看来，一旦找到好的构图方法，就应该检查图片是否有那些通常被认为是不好的东西。

### 图片边缘上的事物造成的分心

Always when composing a photograph one should observe the edges of the frame and look for elements that might be distracting and steal attention from the subject itself. Picture 1 is an example of this kind of situation. The feet of the chair in the upper right corner stand out well. They steal some attention from the cat and lead the eye of the viewer away from the photo. Picture 2 is fixed version of the same photo. Picture 2 is cleaner and the eye of the viewer stays better inside of the photograph.

通常在拍摄照片时，我们应该观察图片的边缘，查看是否存在可能会分散注意力的元素，这些元素是否把你的注意力从拍摄对象转移了过去。 图1是这种情况的一个例子。 右上角的椅子脚很突出。 它偷走了部分本应该聚集在猫身上的注意力，引导观众的目光远离照片。 图2是同一张照片的固定版本。 图2更清晰的表现出图片的主体，观察者注意力也不会被分散。

### 拍摄对象的背景

One should always pay attention to the background of the photographed subject. Sometimes there are elements behind the subject that merge with the subject like in the picture 3. The wing of the butterfly and the flower in the background overlap as if forming one unity. Better way to compose the butterfly is to find cleaner a background for it like in the picture 4. In picture 4 the wing doesn't merge with the background and the form of the subject stands out more. While composing a subject one should ask the following questions:

- Does the subject merge with the background?
- Is the contrast between the subject and the background strong enough so that the subject stands out?
- Does the subject look good on the chosen background?
One way to separate subject and background is the use of complementary colors. Complementary colors are well distinguishable from each other and strengthen each other. Another method to emphasize the subject is to use textures. A subject with complicated texture stands out well from background with simple texture. A subject with simple texture stands out well from background with complicated texture.

人们应该始终关注拍摄对象的背景。 有时在主题背后有元素与主题重合，如图3所示。蝴蝶的翅膀和背景中的花重叠，好像形成一个整体。 更好的构图是使蝴蝶的背景更清晰，如图4所示。在图4中，蝴蝶的翅膀不与背景融合，主体的形状更突出。 在构图时，应该问自己是否出现了以下问题：

- 拍摄对象是否与背景重叠？
- 主体和背景之间的对比是否足够强烈以使主体更加突出？
- 主体在所选背景上看起来如何？
