Kim Jung Gi is an established artist from South Korea whose art work has attracted the international attention of millions over the last few years.  

He has the ability to visualize the drawing before making his marks.  With mental pictures, he can draw without a photographic reference. 

 

"I observe things all the time. I don’t take references while I’m drawing, but I’m always collecting visual resources. I observe them carefully on daily basis, almost habitually. I study images of all sorts and genres, "Kim said, adding that he's been passionate about art since he was a kid."

 

Since 2007, he has published three Sketchbooks which contain more than 2,200 pages of his monumental art work.
