#### Source

```
as soon as I apt-get install something a whole bunch of those errors pops up.
Luckely those installs do succeed.
I can fix the problems by doing a apt-get remove && apt-get install for every package but this is a very time consuming job as you can imagine...

Is there any magic command I can try?
I did:
apt-get autoremove
apt-get clean
apt-get autoclean
aptitude reinstall '~i' 
....

none fixed the problem
Are those errors serious?
and I did googled, but help on those forums was no real help to be honest 
I am running knoppix 6.4.3 (cd) on a usb. I think I screwed up somewhere while remastering but now I copied forester's script and did some changes, no trouble while remastering anymore
